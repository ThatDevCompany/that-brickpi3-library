/**
 * The `lego-port` class provides an interface for working with input and
 * output ports that are compatible with LEGO MINDSTORMS RCX/NXT/EV3, LEGO
 * WeDo and LEGO Power Functions sensors and motors. Supported devices include
 * the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Intelligent Brick, the LEGO WeDo USB hub and
 * various sensor multiplexers from 3rd party manufacturers.
 *
 * Some types of ports may have multiple modes of operation. For example, the
 * input ports on the EV3 brick can communicate with sensors using UART, I2C
 * or analog validate signals - but not all at the same time. Therefore there
 * are multiple modes available to connect to the different types of sensors.
 *
 * In most cases, ports are able to automatically detect what type of sensor
 * or motor is connected. In some cases though, this must be manually specified
 * using the `mode` and `set_device` attributes. The `mode` attribute affects
 * how the port communicates with the connected device. For example the input
 * ports on the EV3 brick can communicate using UART, I2C or analog voltages,
 * but not all at the same time, so the mode must be set to the one that is
 * appropriate for the connected sensor. The `set_device` attribute is used to
 * specify the exact type of sensor that is connected. Note: the mode must be
 * correctly set before setting the sensor type.
 *
 * Ports can be found at `/sys/class/lego-port/port<N>` where `<N>` is
 * incremented each time a new port is registered. Note: The number is not
 * related to the actual port at all - use the `address` attribute to find
 * a specific port.
